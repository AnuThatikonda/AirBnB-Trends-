# Airbnb Trends Dashboard

## Overview

This project showcases an interactive Tableau dashboard built using the Airbnb 2016 dataset. The dashboard highlights various trends in pricing, room types, and customer preferences to provide insights into the Airbnb market.

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains data on listings, calendar, and reviews. For this analysis, only the 2016 listings and calendar data were used due to Tableau's row limitations. The reviews data was excluded as it was not required for the visualizations.
