# Airbnb Trends Dashboard

## Overview

This project showcases an interactive Tableau dashboard built using the Airbnb 2016 dataset. The dashboard highlights various trends in pricing, room types, and customer preferences to provide insights into the Airbnb market.

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains data on listings, calendar, and reviews. For this analysis, only the 2016 listings and calendar data were used due to Tableau's row limitations. The reviews data was excluded as it was not required for the visualizations.

## Project Objectives
To analyze and visualize key trends in Airbnb data from 2016.
To identify patterns in pricing and customer preferences using intuitive visualizations.

## Dataset Details

Source: Kaggle Airbnb 2016 Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset/data)
Filtered: Focused only on the year 2016 for visualizations.
Excluded Data: Reviews data was excluded as it was not relevant to the analysis.

## Visualizations
The following visualizations were created using Tableau:

### Bar Graph: Average Prices by Zipcode

Displays the average price for Airbnb listings across different zip codes.
### Map: Average Prices by Zipcode

A geographical representation of zip codes with average pricing for properties.
### Line Graph: Yearly Price Trends

Shows how Airbnb prices changed over the course of the year.
### Bar Graph: Cost Per Number of Bedrooms

Highlights the pricing trends based on the number of bedrooms.
### Table: Number of Bedrooms vs. Number of Buyers

Provides insight into customer preferences by showing the count of bedrooms versus the number of buyers.
### Square Plot: Average Price Trends by Room Type and Bedroom Count

Compares average prices by room type (Entire Home/Apt, Private Room, Shared Room) and bedroom count.

## Dashboard
The visualizations were combined into a single Airbnb Trends Dashboard, offering a comprehensive view of the data and allowing users to interact with the insights.


## Insights
Price Variation by Zipcode: Clear disparities in pricing were observed across different regions.
Room Type Trends: Entire homes/apartments command higher prices compared to private and shared rooms.
Bedroom Preferences: Customers prefer properties with fewer bedrooms, with trends varying by region.
Seasonal Price Trends: Prices fluctuate throughout the year, indicating seasonality in demand.


## Technical Details
Tool Used: Tableau
Data Rows: Filtered down to 2016 data to meet Tableau's processing limit of 1,500,000 rows.
Exclusions: Reviews data was omitted due to its irrelevance to the visualizations.
